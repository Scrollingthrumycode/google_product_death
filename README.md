# Google Product Death

If you hate the fact that Google is killing off half of the products that you use and love because "not many people use them", you've come to the right place.

## Products/services on death row:
- Inbox by Gmail (March 2019)
- Google+ (August 2019)
- Hangouts (some time in 2019 or 2020, we all know it's happening)
- Allo (that shit was D.O.A.)
